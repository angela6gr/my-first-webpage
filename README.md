# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

This web page was created to help me learn the Gitpod and GitHub interfaces while progressing through the Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer course.

You can see the page [I'm an inline-style link](https://angela6gr.github.io/my-full-template/index.html "here")

The website shows what coding languages will be used through the different stages of the course.

To create it I used HTML and CSS on Gitpod.
